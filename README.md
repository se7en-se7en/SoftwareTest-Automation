Module 8 Questions


As a student learning to code, ensuring that my code is functional and secure is a top priority. To ensure functionality, I start by writing a clear and concise plan for what the program should do and how it should do it. I also make sure to test my code regularly as I'm building it, so that I can catch any errors or bugs early on. When it comes to security, I take a number of measures to protect my code, such as encrypting sensitive data and consistnetly testing for any vulnerabilities.
When it comes to interpreting user needs and incorporating them into a program, I start by talking to the user and gathering as much information as possible about what they need the program to do. I then take that information and use it to create a detailed plan for the program, making sure to incorporate all of the user's requirements. Throughout the development process, I check in with the user regularly to make sure that the program is meeting their needs and making any necessary changes along the way.
Finally, when it comes to designing software, I approach the task by first defining the problem that the software needs to solve. I then work to create a detailed plan for how the software will solve that problem, taking into account factors such as user needs, technical constraints, and available resources. Once I have a solid plan in place, I start building the software, regularly testing and refining it as I go. Throughout the process, I stay focused on creating a user-friendly interface that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
